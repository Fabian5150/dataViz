## Data preprocessing and visualisation
This was my work for a university course I did in my exchange semester at Umeå University in Sweden:\
https://www.umu.se/en/education/courses/data-preprocessing-and-visualisation/

The main goal was to create a learning diary, where for each chapter we should use the recently covered methods
to perform some data analysis on a dataset in order to answer some research questions. (data and question of our own choosing most of the time)

In this repository is all the code I wrote but also my finished learning diary, which gives a much better overview of my work.

This was my first time properly working with data and I enjoyed the process quite a lot, so I wanted to make my repository for it public here after finishing the course.
